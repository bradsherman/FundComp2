This is the repo for the course: Fundamentals of Computing 2, which I took during the Spring of
2016 during my sophomore year at Notre Dame.

Fundamentals of Computing 2 taught me the core concepts of C++ and Object Oriented Programming.
I was then able to apply these concepts together to create different programs throughout the 
course, and I will continue to apply the concepts of OOP that I learned in the future.
