From the user's perspective, this program starts by asking the user to input the numerator
of the first rational, and then the denominator, and then the same for the second rational.
Once they enter their numbers, four functions are computed for them and neatly displayed in
a fractional format. 

Internally, this program starts by asking the user to input their choices for numerator
and denominator for both rationals. Then the two Rational objects are instantiated. A 
check is implemented in the constructor so that if a user enters 0 in the denominator, 
they will continually be prompted until they enter something besides 0. It also uses the 
findGCD function to put the rational fraction in simplest form (using Euclid's algorithm).
Euclid's algorithm basically divides one number by the other, and then divides the previous
divisor by the remainder until the remainder is zero. Once the rational is in simplest 
form I call four functions for both the rationals. I overloaded the <<, =, +, -, *, /, and ^
operators so that I could use the user's rational numbers in four different functions. 
Each of the functions are computed and then neatly displayed to the user.

I evaluated the program for correctness by entering many different combinations of numbers
and ensuring that for each pair of rationals I entered that all four functions produced 
the correct results.
