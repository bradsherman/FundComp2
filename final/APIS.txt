A list of possible API's we can use:

1. Last 10k: https://dev.last10k.com/signup/
	info: 5 calls/min 500 calls/week for free
	RESTful methods

2. xignite: http://www.xignite.com/
	has many different API's we could use
	would have to string together a bunch of 7 day free trials

3. Zack's Sales Estimates: https://www.quandl.com/data/ZSE
	would have to email to ask about possibly getting an
	institutional account

4. Feed Syndicate: https://www.feedsyndicate.com/
	would have to contact to get access

==================================================================

Another option is to just use this website:

http://www.enclout.com/

and then use a C++ library like cpp-netlib or boost to get the
data from the webpage that results from our requests, parse it,
and then use the contents however we want.
